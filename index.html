            A resteraunt where the entire menu is my favorite foods.

        <p>
            I like a wide variety of different foods, and I enjoy eating <br>
            at a variety of different resteraunts. I always wanted a <br>
            resteraunt that had all of my favorite foods in it, but could <br>
            never find one. So I decided to make it myself. The resteraunt <br>
            was fisrt opened earlier this year in March, and buissiness has <br>
            been doing well ever since.
